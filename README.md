## Assignment 1

### Project Name
Webpage: Connecting from Distance

### Project Description

  - What is the project?
  This webpage project was created to house and debut the film that was part of the 30 Minute Film Festival. The webpage is there to give more information and details about the film shoot.
  - What is the overall concept and theme?
  The concept behind the film entry is to tell the story of how three students from different parts of the world studying abroad connect with their families and friends in this digital world. The film depicts the use of different languages and messaging apps by students depending on where the students are coming from. Connecting and disconnecting with people through the use of the technology that is surrounding humans is the main theme of this film.
  - What kind of experience you were striving to create?
  The background music used in the film is calming and relaxing. This is because connecting to our loved ones brings happiness and calmness. In addition, the cast of the film don’t make any physical appearance. This is to show the viewers that the situation the students are in; being away from their loved ones can happen to anyone regardless of where the person is coming from. Through this webpage, I strive to create the same pacifying and relaxing experience the film delivers to the webpage’s visitors.

### Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?
  I try to implement the concept and experience I had for the webpage by using a simple and minimalist style with a light color scheme to set a calming tone similar to the one the video delivers. Furthermore, I smoothed the edges of the sharp-edged squares. The paragraphs, images, and video edges were altered in the webpage to fit into the theme of serenity rather than seriousness and harshness. 

### Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
  This being my first webpage to build was a bit challenging and new. Before developing the webpage, I created a wireframe and had set high expectations for this webpage in terms of its design and aesthetic. However, throughout the process of making the webpage, some of the steps I had set initially to do had to be pushed away because I only had basic web development skills. Instead, my focus at the beginning was to get the basics working and implemented nicely. After I got done with basic, I started styling things the way I want which was hard at the beginning but with watching videos and searching through the web more I had the chance to get some of the styles I wanted to happen. Although my final webpage didn’t turn out to be identical to the wireframe I created because it was hard to get it the same, however, the basics were up and only a few things were altered. Yet, with the basic skills I was able to create a webpage that fits into the theme I wished to deliver which calmness and minimalism.
